# flow-assist

A standalone, **domain-agnostic** TUI/CLI assistant host. It has no notion of
"issue", "board", or "sprint" in its core, and none of any company's systems. Functionality is delivered as
**plugins** that register surfaces, commands, keybindings, LLM tool groups, and
config schema. The bundled `gitlab` and `repo` are tool-group-only plugins; a
plugin with surfaces (views, modals, keys) lives in its own repository and is
dropped into `plugins-available/`, which ignores everything not bundled.

## Language rule

Specs, implementation plans, and **code comments are written in English**. Russian
comments from ported source are translated during the port and are never left in
the new tree. The host's own UI — the chat, its hints, its status line — is
English throughout; a half-translated screen is worse than either language.

## Stack

- TypeScript **7.0.2** (native `tsc`), module `NodeNext`, target `ES2022`, `strict`.
- Bun **1.3.x** — `bun run`, `bun test`. The TUI runs as `bun src/cli.ts`.
  **A `bun build --compile` binary WORKS, given plugins are shipped BUILT** (probed
  end to end on Bun 1.3.14, 2026-09-21: pack → install → the compiled host draws the
  tracker's board). The one limit: inside a compiled binary a runtime `import()` of
  an on-disk package fails with "Cannot find module" when that package's
  `package.json` has an **`exports`** field — scoped or not, string or conditions
  (`main`-only packages and deep paths resolve). So a plugin run from SOURCE with its
  own `node_modules` is skipped by the binary; a plugin bundled into one file has no
  on-disk package left to resolve, and loads. It was never a two-React problem —
  plugins take hooks from `ft` and import only types from React.
- **A published plugin ships no `node_modules`** (`packPlugin` in
  `scripts/publish.ts`). With dependencies it must have a `build` script that bundles
  them into `package.json`'s `main` (React and flowtty external — the host provides
  them); publishing runs it and ships the build without `src/`. No dependencies →
  the sources ship as they are. Dependencies and no `build` → publishing refuses. The
  loader takes `main` first and falls back to `src/` only when it is missing, which
  is what a working copy in `plugins-available/` relies on.
- React 19 + `@flowtty/react` / `@flowtty/tty-backend`, zod 4.

## Repos

- `flow-assist` — this host. Plugin sources live under `plugins-available/`, each a package with its own dependencies; the host never imports a plugin or a plugin's dependency.

## Layout

```
flow-assist/
├── package.json               # host; workspace root for plugins-available/*
├── plugins-available/
│   ├── gitlab/                # glab_api tool group (no UI)

```

A plugin lives in `plugins-available/<name>/`, ships a `manifest.json` (name,
version, description, `deps`, `surfaces`, `tools`), and is enabled by symlinking
it into `plugins-enabled/`. At load time the host qualifies every registry key
with the plugin namespace (`<plugin>:<view>`, `<plugin>:<tool>`), while display
labels keep short names.

## Plugin contract (`shape`)

A plugin module default-exports `build<Name>Plugin({ renders, config, make })`.
`make(name, shape)` injects `config.plugins.<name>` and qualified keys. The
returned `shape` has optional: `commands`, `keys`, `keyActions`, `views`,
`surface`, `modals`, `colors`, `configSchema`, `components`, `tools`, `services`,
`aiTools`, `keycaps(ft)`, `entry`, `setup(ft)`. `components[slot] = (ft) => Component`;
`services` expose host services through `ft.services` — the host wins on every
key it owns, a plugin's same-named key never clobbers it. `setup(ft)` runs once,
before any of the plugin's components mount (it is where a plugin seeds its store). Tool groups are delivered by plugins — there is
**no** `tools-available/` → `tools-enabled/` repository; `ai.disabledTools` is
the blacklist.

### A handled key is followed by a redraw

A plugin usually keeps its state in ONE component (a workspace that publishes it on
`ft.services`) and draws it in a SIBLING. A React `setState` in the first re-renders
the first only; the sibling redraws when the host re-renders. That used to require an
explicit `ft.notify()` in every setter, and a setter without one — the tracker's info
panel cursor, `setPanelIdx` — changed the state and froze on screen. It looked
intermittent: while related issues were still loading, each arriving name called
`notify()` and so "showed" the pending key presses; once loading finished, the cursor
stopped moving.

The host guarantees it: `useInput` in `runtime/app.tsx` calls `notify()` after every
key that was handled (`twoPhaseDispatch` returned true). React batches it with
whatever the handler set. A plugin still calls `ft.notify()` for changes that do NOT
come from a key — a fetch that finished, a timer.

### A plugin is a guest: whose screen it is

The app opens on the HOST's start screen (`src/views/home.ts`: the ƒ mark drawn
large, what can be done from here, the enabled plugins). flow-assist grew out of a
tracker TUI and for a long time still opened like one — every plugin component
mounted from the first frame, so the tracker's board drew "No board data" over an
assistant nobody had asked for a board.

- A plugin's **surface** — its own full screen — is the component slot named `view`,
  or named after `shape.surface`. Every other slot (modals, key triggers, the
  workspace that feeds them) is furniture and is always mounted, which is how a
  plugin's own key (`c`, the board picker) works from the start screen.
- The surface is mounted **only while the plugin says its context is active**:
  `keycaps(ft)` non-empty. That is the existing contract of `keycaps` ("returns `[]`
  when its surface is inactive"), so a plugin needs no new API to be a good guest. A
  plugin with a surface and no `keycaps` cannot say, and is shown always.
- Over a guest's surface the host keeps its title bar; on the start screen it does not.
- The start screen lists guests in three aligned columns: name · the key that leads
  in · what it is. The key comes ONLY from `shape.entry?: string[]` (action names) —
  a key on screen is an instruction, and listing every key a plugin binds put
  "⏎ open" beside a tracker with nothing open, where Enter did nothing. The
  description is `shape.description`, filled by the loader from the plugin's
  `manifest.json`; a long one wraps inside its column.
- The block is centred on both axes; inside it rows keep a common left edge.
- The start screen draws keys with `bindingGlyph(keys[action])` and offers nothing
  that is unbound.

## What the model can do (the `core` tool group)

`memory`, `config_schema`, `datetime`, `remind`, `background`, `todo`, `ask_user`,
`open_url`, plus `host:plugins_list`. Three rules hold this set together:

- **Config is the person's.** The model gets `config_schema` — keys, types,
  set/unset, active defaults, effective key bindings, each plugin's flags — and
  **no values and no write**. Config is the model's own leash (`disabledTools`,
  `baseUrl`, `tokenEnv`, plugin roots) and the assistant reads other people's text,
  so even a y/n-confirmed write is one prompt injection plus one tired keypress
  away. The model answers with the `config set <key> <value>` command to run.
- **The log is the person's too.** No log tool; `/log [N]` shares the tail of the
  host log as the person's own message.
- **`ask_user`** (1–4 questions, 2–4 options each, optional multi-select, an
  "Other…" row the UI always adds) is a pure state machine in
  `src/assistant/ask.ts`; the chat owns only the pause and the render. A
  background task is never given the hook — a question popping up would seize the
  keyboard mid-sentence — so there the tool answers "nobody to ask".
- **The memory is the person's too.** The `memory` tool is the model's: a stored fact
  goes into the system prompt of EVERY later request — across `/clear`, across
  restarts. That is its purpose, and it is also why "after /clear the assistant still
  knew my earlier prompt" looked like `/clear` failing: the conversation was gone, the
  memory was not, and nothing said so. So `/clear` reports what it kept
  (`keptAfterClear`), and `/memory` lists and `/memory forget <n|all>` removes — without
  going through the model (`src/assistant/memory-command.ts`). What the host tells the
  person this way is a display-only message of role `note`; `apiHistory` drops it, and
  the model's history (`apiRef`) never holds it.
- **How full the context is, is shown — and says where the number came from.** The
  chat's hint line ends in `ctx N%` (yellow from 80%), and `/context` prints a bar and
  a breakdown by part as a `note` (`src/assistant/context-meter.ts`, pure). The total
  is the provider's `prompt_tokens + completion_tokens` of the last round when it
  reports usage (`stream_options.include_usage`; a server that refuses the field by
  name is retried once without it and not asked again); until then it is characters/4
  and drawn `~N%`. The split between parts is always an estimate, scaled to the total.
  The window is `ai.contextWindow` (default 200000) — the API cannot be asked for it.
  `/compact`, `/clear` and a change of conversation drop the measurement. There is no
  `/refresh-context`: the system prompt is assembled anew for every message, so the
  command had nothing to refresh.
- **The plan (`todo`) belongs to a conversation, not to the process.**
  `createPlan()` in `src/assistant/plan.ts` makes one; its owner passes it to the
  tool as `ctx.plan`. The chat holds its own (`planRef`), and `/clear` resets it; a
  background run gets a fresh one, so its checkboxes never appear among the chat's;
  an eval trial makes one per trial. Only a caller with no conversation of its own
  (the one-shot CLI, a bare `execChatTool`) falls back to the process-wide plan.
  **Tool state that describes a conversation is never module-level** — as a module
  variable the plan outlived `/clear`, was shared with background runs, and leaked
  from one test into the next.

A qualified tool name (`plugin:tool`) is translated to a provider-safe wire name
(`plugin__tool`) in `src/assistant/agent.ts` and nowhere else: providers validate
names against `^[a-zA-Z0-9_-]{1,128}$`.

### How a tool gets its name

**The model sees the name the plugin gave** — `get_issue`, `open_issue`, `read_file` —
for group tools (`shape.tools`) and standalone ones (`shape.aiTools`) alike. No plugin
prefix: it is shorter, costs fewer tokens on every request, and the model has no use
for which plugin stands behind a tool. (The loader used to qualify aiTools and not
group tools, so one plugin's tools arrived as both `get_issue` and
`acme-tracker__open_issue`.) The loader neither adds a prefix nor takes one away: a
plugin that wrote `x:tool` itself gets exactly that.

A prefix appears only when it is NEEDED. **A name is claimed once**: the first group to
declare it keeps the bare word; a later group's tool is registered as `<plugin>:<name>`
instead and the clash is said (`[tools] "search" is declared by both …`). The registry
remembers the tool's own name (`ownName`) because that is what the group's `exec`
understands. Without this a clash is silent — the provider's "Duplicate tool name" 400
no longer fires, since `agentChat` sends one declaration per name.

The host's own groups: `core` is bare (`memory`, `todo`), `host` qualifies its names
itself (`host:plugins_list`). Names reach the provider through the wire translation in
`agent.ts` (`:` → `__`).

### A tool argument is hostile input

The model writes every argument, and what it read a minute ago (a ticket, a README,
a web page) may have told it what to write. A tool that pauses for y/n is guarded by
a person; a **read-only tool is guarded by nothing**, so it is the one to check
hardest. Rules the `repo` and `gitlab` plugins hold, each with a test that tries it:

- **A value that reaches a CLI's argv never starts with `-`**, and refs go after
  `--end-of-options`. `git diff --output=<file>` writes a file from a "read" tool.
- **A path check is on the real path, not the spelled one** — a clone may carry a
  symlink out of the root (`realOf` in `repo`, which also handles a path that does
  not exist yet and a dangling link).
- **A configured root is never deleted**, confirmed or not.
- **No "magic" flags**: glab's `--field` reads `@path` from disk; strings go through
  `--raw-field`. Check the same before wrapping any other CLI (`gh api -F` is alike —
  this applies to the planned `github` plugin).

### A tool's result is what the model will tell the person

- **A failure is reported as a failure, in the failing thing's own words.** The
  `gitlab` plugin's `glab` runner was a stub that answered `{}` to everything; the
  model made five calls, read five empty objects, and told the person with full
  confidence to run `glab auth login`. A wrapper returns the exit code and stderr,
  says "not installed" when the binary is missing, says "empty body" when it is
  empty, and times out instead of hanging the turn (`plugins-available/gitlab/src/glab.ts`).
- **A tool that can never work is not offered.** `get_feature_context` always answered
  "unavailable" — nothing ever supplied its context — yet it sat first in the list
  and the model called it. A dead tool costs a call, tokens on every request, and a
  wrong turn in the reasoning. Remove it, do not leave it answering "unavailable".

## The conversation the model sees

**The chat's display list is never the model's history.** `agentChat` returns the
turn's `transcript` (assistant messages with `tool_calls`, every tool result, the
final answer) and the chat keeps it in a model-side history (`apiRef`) beside the
display list; `apiHistory()` sends API fields only and never half of a
call/result pair. Replaying only each turn's final text shows the model a
conversation in which state changed with no tool call in sight, and it imitates
that: it narrates the change and guesses at state. `scripts/eval-tool-use.ts`
measured it — 1 tool call in 15 turns with 14 false claims, against 15 in 15 with
none. `/compact`'s summary rides in the system context of every later turn for the
same reason: a display-only system message never reaches the model.

## The command line

`:` opens it. It completes **inline, on its one row**, as the chat's field does: the
untyped rest of the suggestion after the caret, the other candidates beside it as
`⇥ a · b`; Tab takes the offer and then walks the rest. The logic is pure —
`lineView` / `lineTab` in `src/config/commandline.ts` — and both the drawing and Tab go
through the one `completeLine`. Never add a row that appears while typing: the old
second row of candidates made the whole screen jump with every keystroke. Tab
replaces the WORD being completed (`stem + candidate`), a command name or a
`config get|set|unset` argument alike.

- **A command is its first word**; the rest of the line is its argument. The whole
  line used to be looked up, so every plugin command given an argument was not found
  and did nothing — `:ask hi`, a tracker's `:open ABC-1`. Without an argument they
  worked, which is how it went unnoticed.
- **Nothing is silent.** An unknown command answers `Unknown command: x — try :help`.
  A command that is listed does something: `view` and `back` set a state nothing in
  the host reads and were removed. The host's commands are `clear`, `quit`, `config`,
  `cache`, `help`; everything else is a plugin's.

## The chat

- Who speaks is said by a **gutter marker and a ground**, not a label: `›` on the
  user ground for the person (the input field's own prompt), `ƒ` for the
  assistant's answer (also signing the frame, `ƒ Flow Assist`), `◆` on its own
  ground for a background result. Colours come from `theme.modals.chat` (`accent`,
  `assistantAccent`, `userBg`, `fieldBg`, `bgAccent`, `bgBg`, `warn`, `ok`) and are
  overridable via `config.plugins.assistant.colors`.
- A marker is ONE narrow code point: flowtty's grid counts one cell per code point,
  so an East-Asian-ambiguous glyph (`∮`, `≈`, most of Mathematical Operators)
  shifts the row in terminals that draw it two cells wide.
- Markdown in answers — tables included — is laid out by flowtty's
  `layoutMarkdown`. The host adds nothing but the soft `▍` heading marker; a gap in
  that layout is fixed in flowtty, not papered over here.
- **⏎** sends; while an answer is coming it **queues** instead (sent in order when
  the turn ends). **Esc**: clear the field → take the last queued message back →
  stop the answer → arm/close. **Alt+⏎** (drawn `⌥⏎` on macOS) is a newline (`NEWLINE_KEY` in
  `src/views/modals.ts` — the one spelling every hint uses); a blank line is kept.
  ⇧⏎ works too where the terminal sends it (decoded since flowtty 1.0.0-alpha.7),
  but the hint names the key that works in every terminal that has an Alt.
- **A key has two names, and they meet in one place.** The TERMINAL's name is what
  flowtty's decoder gives as `key.name`: `'return'`, `' '`, `':'`, `'escape'`. A
  PERSON's name is what gets written in a binding — `config.keys`, a plugin's `keys`
  table: `"enter"`, `"space"`, `"colon"`, `"esc"`. `canonicalBinding` in
  `src/playback/keys.ts` turns the second into the first, once, when `buildKeys` /
  `resolveKeys` assemble the map; `writtenKey` goes back for anything shown in words
  (the model's `config_schema`). So: a **binding** may say `'enter'`; a **comparison**
  (`key.name === …`, a test's `press(…)`) must use the terminal's name — there is no
  `'enter'`, `'space'` or `'colon'` there, and flowtty's `TestBackend.press()` throws
  on them.
  - What is DRAWN for a key is the **third** vocabulary: `keyGlyph` in the same file
    — `⏎ ␣ ⇥ ⌫ ↑`, `^r`, `⌥⏎`, `⇧⇥`; one code point per glyph, a short word where no
    glyph exists. The keycaps panel draws pressed keys with it (the raw name read
    `return`, and `' '` drew an empty cap). Alt is `⌥` on macOS and `Alt+` elsewhere
    (`META_CAP`).
  - **Never write a key's symbol by hand in a hint.** Two cases:
    - the action is BOUND (it is in `ft.keys`, so the person can remap it) → draw
      `ft.keyCap(action)`; it is `''` when the action is unbound, and then the hint is
      not shown at all. The host footer (`composeFooterHints`) and the chat's
      `A chat` hint do this. Host-side code uses `bindingGlyph(keys[action])`.
    - the key is fixed (the chat's own Enter / Esc / Tab) → `keyGlyph(…)`, as the
      `CAP` table in `src/views/modals.ts` does.
    A bundled plugin that still spells caps by hand in its `keycaps(ft)` (acme-tracker)
    shows the default key after a remap — that is the bug this rule prevents.
- **A key acts where it is shown, and is shown where it acts.** Audited 2026-09-21:
  - `x` flushed the cache from the start screen, where the footer did not offer it.
    The hint and the key now read ONE predicate, `cacheInPlay` (`loader/registry.ts`):
    a plugin that keeps data in the cache is on screen. `:clear` works from anywhere.
  - Flushing the cache (`x`, `:clear`) also **reloads what is on screen**: the host
    counts flushes in `services.cacheEpoch`, and a plugin that draws cached data
    reloads when the number changes (`useEffect(..., [ft.services.cacheEpoch])`). A
    flush that left the open board as it was read as a key that does nothing.
  - `b` was answered by the host with "no target (tracker supplies the URL)". The host
    no longer handles it. `openBrowser`, `prev`, `next` and `open` stay in
    `HOST_DEFAULT_KEYS` only as a shared vocabulary for plugins (a plugin reads
    `ft.keys.open`); the host acts on none of them.
  - A test presses every lower-case letter on the start screen and expects silence.
- **A capital opens something big**: `A` the assistant, `L` the log; a plugin's main
  screen should follow (`B` for a board). Lower case is for what is INSIDE a screen.
  A modal is closed by the key it is bound to (`f.keys.<action>`), never by a letter
  written in the handler — the log used to close on a hard-coded `l`.
- **↑/↓** walk the prompt history, only while the field is empty or still shows a
  history entry untouched. The **wheel** and **PgUp/PgDn** scroll. **^r** unfolds
  thinking, notes and the tool calls behind the one-line `▸ N tools` summary.
- A **paste** is one key, `{ name: 'paste', text }` (flowtty's bracketed paste): it
  goes in at the caret with its line breaks kept. It is never decoded into keys, so
  a pasted newline does not send and pasted letters fire no binding — any new
  key handler must keep it that way (match on `key.name`, never on characters of
  pasted text).
- The wheel is reported because the TTY backend is opened with `{ mouse }`, on
  unless `ui.mouse` is `false`. The cost is the terminal's own drag-to-select,
  which then needs Shift (Option on macOS); the active default in `config_schema`
  says so, because "why can't I select text" is asked of the assistant.
- A `/command` **completes inline**, like a shell's autosuggestion: the part not
  typed yet is drawn after the caret in the dimmed accent colour, the other
  candidates follow as `⇥ a · b`, **Tab** takes the offer and then walks the rest.
  Only with the caret at the end of a one-line `/word`. In the field, dim means
  "offered, not yours yet" — the person's own text is never dimmed, on either side
  of the caret.
- A **background result** (the `background` tool's nested run finishing) is SHOWN as
  soon as no turn is being written — a half-typed draft does not hold it back. It
  does not open the chat and does not spend a model turn: it joins the model's
  history and is read with the person's next message. Landing while the chat is
  closed, it is counted as unread; the host footer shows `A chat · ◆ N new` through
  the chat plugin's `keycaps`, and opening the chat clears the count.
  `ai.backgroundFollowUp: true` opts back into a turn per result, and then only
  with the chat open, the field empty and nothing queued.
- What the footer reads from a plugin (`ft.store.<x>`) must be patched
  synchronously when it changes: the host draws its footer BEFORE the plugin's
  component re-renders, so a value assigned during render is one frame stale.
- A tool's ctx is built with `allServices(ft.services)`, never `...ft.services`:
  host services sit on the PROTOTYPE of the per-plugin services view, and a spread
  copies own properties only. The spread silently gave tools a ctx with no
  `chatLLM`/`config`/`showMessage`, and `background` answered "no LLM service".
- The conversation is a flowtty **`<ScrollBox anchor="bottom">`** (`ChatMessages` in
  `src/views/modals.ts`): it takes the rows the column leaves, follows new rows until
  the person scrolls up, and hears PgUp/PgDn and the wheel ITSELF — the chat's key
  handler must not. No heights are added up anywhere: a new block under the
  conversation needs `flexShrink: 0` and nothing else. Sending a message calls
  `scrollToEnd()`.
  - The **wheel scrolls only while the pointer is over the box**. In a test pass
    coordinates — `backend.wheel('up', 20, 8)`; the default `(0, 0)` is the app title.
  - Every `ChatRow` is exactly one terminal line; the pinned-question check reads a
    row's index as its line. A row that wraps would break it. Long lines of fenced
    code are hard-wrapped by `layoutMarkdown` since flowtty 1.0.0-alpha.11 (before,
    one ran out of its box as a single over-wide row); a test holds it.
- **One look for every host modal** — the chat's: `frame()` in `src/views/modals.ts`
  (round border, the modal palette, a plain title) and a quiet hint line at the bottom
  saying how to move and how to get out. The log and the help wore a double frame of
  their own, so one product looked like two.
  - A modal is **as tall as what it holds** and never taller than the screen; what does
    not fit scrolls (`<ScrollBox scrollbar>` — the bar is how a person learns there is
    more). The help used to run off both ends of the terminal with no way to scroll.
  - **The log** stamps each entry with its time (`services/log.ts`), and what a line IS
    decides how loud it is: a failure red, `[bg]` the background's colour, the
    model-round bookkeeping and the stamp dim.
  - **The help** answers two questions — which keys, which commands. Keys are drawn
    with `bindingGlyph` and split in two: the ones the HOST acts on anywhere
    (`HOST_ACTIONS`), and the ones that belong to a plugin's own screen (`prev`, `next`,
    `open`, … — the host only gives them a default). A key in a help list is an
    instruction, so a key that does nothing here is not listed as if it did.
    `helpEntries` gives one entry per word a person types: a plugin's `core:quit` and
    the host's `quit` are the same word, and the described one wins.
  - A modal opened by a key names that key in the footer through `keycaps` (`L log`),
    and the flag the footer reads is patched synchronously AND followed by `notify()`
    on close as well as on open — the host draws the footer before the plugin re-renders.
- Every host modal is centred on one full-screen layer, `overlay()` in
  `src/views/modals.ts`, which carries `backdrop: 'dim'`: the screen behind a modal
  keeps its characters and colours and steps back. A new modal uses `overlay()` —
  do not rebuild the absolute box by hand (there were four copies of it).
  - Rows are cached per message OBJECT (`rowCache`, a WeakMap). It is correct only
    because the chat replaces a message and never mutates one — keep every
    `setMessages` updater that way.
  - The last question, once scrolled out of view, is pinned as an OVERLAY — an
    absolute child of the box, over its top row — so pinning never shifts the rows
    being read. Needs flowtty ≥ 1.0.0-alpha.9 (before it, an overlay and the
    `scrollbar` vanished under any ancestor with `padding`). It is not pinned when
    the box has fewer than `MIN_ROWS_TO_PIN` rows.
- The field's EDITING is flowtty's `editorReducer` (`multiline`, ≥ 1.0.0-alpha.8),
  called from the chat's key handler after the chat's own keys (Esc ladder, Tab
  completion, history, ^r); its geometry (`inputRows`, `caretPosition`) draws the
  rows in `inputVisualRows`. So caret motion by character / word / visual row,
  Home/End and the kill bindings per line, paste and the newline keys are NOT host
  code — do not re-add branches for them. The reducer answers `submit` for a plain
  Enter; what submit means (send, queue, run a `/command`) stays here.
  - `<TextArea>` itself is not mounted: the host has ONE key dispatcher
    (`useInputHandler`), and a mounted field would be a second listener.
  - The caret (`cursor`) is a **UTF-16 index into the value, resting on a code-point
    boundary** — flowtty's unit. `value.slice(0, cursor)` works; `Array.from(value)`
    indices do not. Columns are counted in characters.
  - Newline keys: **Alt+⏎** (what the hints name), Shift+⏎ where the terminal sends
    it, and backslash-then-⏎, which works everywhere.
  - In a draft ↑/↓ move the caret between rows; they walk history only while the
    field is empty or shows an untouched history entry.
  - `chatFieldWidth(width)` is the one place the field's width is computed — the
    view and the key handler must agree on it, or ↑/↓ land in the wrong column.

## CLI

- **The interactive screen needs a terminal on both ends** (it draws on stdout, reads
  keys from stdin). `runInteractive` checks first (`interactiveRefusal`, on flowtty's
  `isInteractive`) and answers a pipe / CI / redirected input with a sentence, the
  one-shot form that does work there, and exit code 1. Since flowtty 1.0.0-alpha.12
  `new TtyBackend()` THROWS without an interactive stdout, so the backend is built on
  the interactive path ONLY — never before a subcommand has been ruled out, or
  `flow-assist config get x | jq` dies.
- flowtty restores the terminal on SIGINT / SIGTERM / SIGHUP itself and honours
  `NO_COLOR` / `FORCE_COLOR`; the host adds no handler or colour flag of its own.

`flow-assist` with subcommands:

- (default) `interactive` — the TUI.
- `config get|set|unset|help` — host config.
- `plugins ls|install|remove|update` — manage enabled plugins.
- any other arg — a one-shot `<prompt>` chat with the loaded tool registry.

## Config & environment

- Config: `~/.config/flow-assist/config.json` (schema from each plugin's `configSchema`).
- Environment: the host reads `LLM_TOKEN` (or `ai.tokenEnv`) and the optional `FLOW_ASSIST_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_URL` / `FLOW_ASSIST_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_PROJECT` / `FLOW_ASSIST_PLUGIN_REGISTRY_TOKEN`; host variables take the `FLOW_ASSIST_` prefix. A plugin owns its own variables and declares them in `requiredSettings`.
- `config.user` (`name`, `login`) is the only source of the person's identity in the chat context — never the environment or the OS account.

## Testing

From the host root: `bun run typecheck && bun test ./src ./scripts` (the path
filter keeps a locally dropped-in plugin's suite out of the host run).
Plugin tests: `cd plugins-available/<name> && bun test`.
The host suite must pass with `plugins-available/` empty — a host test never loads a real plugin.

- `src/__tests__/helpers/scripted.ts` — a scripted model and a booted app: the
  REAL TUI on a test backend with only the network replaced. Steps are text,
  a tool call, or a `hold` that freezes the stream until `release()`. End-to-end
  tests drive the app through it; assert on the frame AND on cell styles
  (`backend.lastBuffer`).
- `bun scripts/ui-frames.ts [--size WxH] [--color|--styles] [scenario…]` — the same
  rig for eyes: frames at named checkpoints, no network. Look at a display change
  before and after with it.
- `bun scripts/eval-tool-use.ts` — a behavioural eval against a LIVE model (costs
  money; `--fake` checks the harness): rates by turn, false claims, `--history
  display|api` as an A/B, `--show` prints the dialogue.
- A fake for a validating route must reject what the real one rejects; prove a
  new test fails on the bug before trusting it.

## Git

- **Never** append a `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailer (or any Claude
  `Co-Authored-By`) to a commit message.
- Branch from `master`; the default branch here is `master`.
